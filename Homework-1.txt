Using only the techniques you learned in this chapter, write a program that 
calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and uses tabs to print
the following table of values:

2.32 (Body Mass Index Calculator) We introduced the body mass index (BMI) calculator in
Exercise 1.11. The formulas for calculating BMI are

the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so the user can eval-

[Note: In this chapter, you learned to use the int type to represent whole numbers. The BMI calcu-
lations when done with int values will both produce whole-number results. In Chapter 4 you’ll
learn to use the double type to represent numbers with decimal points. When the BMI calculations
are performed with doubles, they’ll both produce numbers with decimal points—these are called
“floating-point” numbers.]
